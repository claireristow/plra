                    <p class="special">Happy Canada Day!</p>
                    <p>On behalf of the PLRA Board, we extend our warmest
                    welcome and wish you all an enjoyable and pleasant
                    summer at Percy Lake with friends and family.
                    For the coming week, we wish you all a happy holiday,
                    especially the long week - end be it celebrating Canada Day and /or Independence Day.</p>
                    <p>Just a few items to note:</p>
                    <p class="subheading">PLRA Membership - Reminder</p>
                    <p>The annual PLRA membership fee is a modest $30 per family.
                    A reminder to renew and/or join PLRA was sent out a couple weeks ago, so this is another reminder of the value and
                    importance of joining PLRA.</p>
                    <p>A membership form is included for your convenience.</p>
                    <p>WEATHER AND LAKE WATER LEVELS - Haliburton and Northern Areas</p>
                    <p>Needless to say, the weather has been erratic and somewhat unpredictable. Most recently, a tornado-like storm hit North Curry Rd mid-June, resulting in a lengthy power outage (about 52 hours for Percy Lake) and heavy rainfall.</p>
                    <p>Parks Canada's water management team monitors water levels and flows, and weather forecasts to determine dam operations on a daily basis for the Trent-Severn Waterway. Accordingly to their site, "rainfall amounts for May and June have been significally below normal with highly localised precipitation events. The current 14 day forecast suggests a transition to high temperatures (about 20 mm of rain forecasted for June 27th and about an additional 30 mm in the longer range forecast.)"</p>
                    <p>Most lakes are near long term average water levels. The Gull River reservoirs are 95% full and Burnt River reservoirs
                    are 93% full. The Central Reservoirs are 98% full. Depending on the rain received on the 27th, the drawdown could begin
                    as early as the end of the week. In the Haliburton reservoir lakes area, drawdown occurs throughout the summer season
                    to address downstream needs along the Trent-Severn Waterway. The high water levels are forecast to ease, as drawdown
                    begins.</p>
                    <p>

                    <p class="subheading">The Oblong Bridge, Fort Irwin:</p>
                    <p>Bridge reconstruction has just begun, resulting in the roadway being reduced to one lane, so be careful when turning
                    into Ft Irwin. Considering the condition of the bridge, and its vital importance, we are relieved that this work has
                    finally begun.</p>

                <div class="articleContent">
                    <p>On behalf of the PLRA Board, we extend our warmest welcome and wish you all an enjoyable and pleasant summer at Percy Lake with friends and family.</p>
                    <p>As you are no doubt aware, the weather this winter and the onset of spring, along with recent storms have been erratic and unpredictable. The photo of our bay shows ice still on the lake in early May– although the ice was gone the next day. As noted in the Haliburton Echo, the “ice out date” on Haliburton’s Head Lake on May 5 this year, broke the record set in 1956 by one day.</p>
                    <p>Last year, we witnessed record high water levels in many lakes and rivers, resulting in flooding in many communities, Minden for example. This year, spring levels were lower than 2016/2017, due to less precipitation in March. We offer no predictions for this summer, but in light of climate uncertainty and other factors, it is best to be cautious and take heed of story weather. Included in this Update (p.6) is a graph indicating estimated water levels and precipitation for
                    the year 2018.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">Current Matters - Updates</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Lake Trout Assessment - </span>In August 2017, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) conducted a low-mortality Lake Trout population assessment. This topic is of great interest, not only for anglers but for all of us who value the health of the Lake. Adam Chalice of the MNRF was the lead of this study and the author of the article on the assessment for the Update.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Percy Lake Dam Restoration - </span>Parks Canada Percy Lake / Gull River Dam Repair Project: The following work site activities have either been completed or yet to be scheduled.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Area land survey to confirm boundaries <span>2017 Completed</span></li>

                    <p>During all phases of work, the portage trail will be open for public use. Some of the wood resulting from this work was donated to ‘Haliburton Fuel for Warmth’ program located at Abbey Gardens.</p>

                            <p>The AGM is a time where questions can be raised for our elected officials, information is exchanged, and is a great social opportunity for you to get to know your neighbours and renew your annual membership! Light refreshments will be

                                    <p>This contest is open for the entire legal fishing season for both lake trout and bass. If you prefer to catch and release, you will need to have a witness to measure the fish length, take a photo, record the date and for entry in the contest, email the information including the anglers name and age to any director or to info@plra.net.</p>
                                    <p>This contest is open to Percy Lake Ratepayers’ members and their families. Trophies will be presented at the following year’s AGM. Tight lines usually means “fish on”, so young anglers, let’s see your photos and hear your fish stories.</p>
                                    <p>In addition, in honour of the late Richard “Dick” Graesser’s passion for fishing, his family is sponsoring a trophy for a cottager’s non-family visiting guest 16 years and younger. The same rules apply as for the full season trout and bass. This award will be presented at the following year’s AGM. It’s not too late to send in photos for last season. Forward them by June 30, 2018 to be included at this year’s AGM presentation.</p>

                        <p>Percy Lake was identified as a candidate for the introduction of the Kingscote ‘Silver’ lake trout by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) in the early 2000’s due to its proximity to Kingscote Lake in Algonquin Park (about 10 km), the relatively simple fish community, available habitat and similar basin characteristics. This introduction was done to provide an additional self-sustaining population of the ‘Silver’ strain of lake trout as it was endemic to Kingscote Lake and there were concerns about the long-term sustainability of the Kingscote population.
                        Stocking of the Kingscote Silvers occurred in Percy Lake between 2002 and 2013.</p>
                        <p>This past summer, MNRF, Bancroft District conducted a low-mortality Lake Trout population assessment using benthic gillnets set for 2 hour durations to assess the survivorship of the stocked Silvers and also to get a sense on whether
                        natural reproduction of Silvers had begun. Catch rates were very good, with the vast majority of fish captured appearing to be stocked Silver strain lake trout with fin clips, a few unclipped Silver lake trout, and a few Manitou strain lake trout which had naturalized in Percy Lake following historical stockings between 1964 and 1996. Genetic confirmation of the lineage as well as the age of each lake trout captured is yet to be confirmed, however, survivorship of the stocked fish appears to be strong. Habitat quality including dissolved oxygen for lake trout was very good at the time of the survey in late August 2017.</p>
                        <p>Lake trout in the Haliburton area are typically small-bodied and have slow growth rates. Percy Lake is no exception. To give a sense of the slow growth rates of Silvers in Percy, a mature female Silver that was caught had a left pectoral clip with a fork length of 374mm. We know that this fish was stocked in the Spring of 2010 as a yearling (over 1 year old) as that was the only year with a left pectoral clip that was stocked into Percy. That means this fish was 8.5 years old at 374mm (14.72 inches) when caught in late August 2017. Recognizing the slow growth and maturity rates of
                        Percy Lake’s Silver lake trout and the low number of unclipped Silvers, it is still early days to see any natural reproduction of Silvers in Percy Lake. This highlights the vulnerability of lake trout and our collective responsibility to conserve them.</p>
                        <p>Dedicated lake trout anglers are encouraged to complete angler diaries of the fishing efforts on Percy Lake or any Haliburton trout lakes. As indicated on the diary form (refer to link below), public input is crucial to the development of sound District fisheries programs.</p>

                    <p class="special">Happy Canada Day!</p>
                    <p>On behalf of the PLRA Board, we extend our warmest welcome and wish you all an enjoyable and pleasant summer at Percy Lake with friends and family. For the coming week, we wish you all a happy holiday, especially the long week-end be it celebrating Canada Day and/or Independence Day. Transiting from winter to spring, while ice thickness and snow depth was “average” this winter, the ice break-up in the spring affected a number of docks - some broke free, while others became “twisted” or shifted somewhat, likely due to a west wind right at the time of break- up.</p>
                    <p>Needless to say, the weather this spring, accompanied by an inordinate amount of rain, has been erratic and somewhat unpredictable, resulting in record high water levels in many lakes and rivers. While the trees and plants are flourishing, many communities, Minden for example, have experienced flooding to a degree that led to an emergency situation. So if we dare predict the weather this summer, the safe bet may well be rain.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">Current Matters</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Internet Service: </span>There have been a number of concerns raised by residents of the Haliburton and Percy Lake areas with respect to the
                    reliability and quality of internet service provided by Bell. The Percy Lake Board will try to keep you informed about the status of service and actions that may be taken to improve the service.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Roads and the Oblong Bridge: </span>While some road work has been slated for this year, unfortunately there is no work being planned for the bridge at Fort Irwin. This remains disconcerting, and even moreso, considering the condition of the bridge, its vital importance, and the potential impacts from the rather excessive rainfall this year alone. <span>Landfills: </span>The West Bay Landfill will continue to operate as in the past. Any changes regarding waste disposal and landfills that may be proposed at a later date by the province and municipality would be subject to consultation.</p>
                    <p><span>Break-in and Entries (B&Es): </span>As noted in the April 2017 Update, 7 B&E's were reported after Christmas at cottages on Percy and Ross lakes. The B&E
                    pattern was fairly consistent - cutting phone wires to disarm alarms systems, forced entry through windows or doors, extensive rummaging, but little to no destructive activity. Following these break-ins, two OPP officers snowshoed to cottages on Johnson Bay Rd. on January 13, 2017, and “tagged” cottages along the way as an indication of their presence. An OPP officer will be attending our AGM this year, and this will likely be an important item for discussion.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">Love Your Lake (LYL) Program</p>
                    <p>Those who participated in this shoreline evaluation program in August 2016 would have received confidential feedback on the health of their shoreline. In total, 110 properties were assessed, representing about 10 km of shoreline on Percy Lake.</p>
                    <p>Each property was classified into four possible categories (natural, regenerative, ornamental and degraded), based on shoreline development, retaining walls and shoreline vegetation. According to the methodology used, 12 properties were classified as majority natural, 10 as majority ornamental, 86 were considered majority regenerative and 2 were not
                    classified.</p>
                    <p>Details of the program and the evaluation are available in the “Percy Lake Shoreline Assessment Summary Report”. If you wish an electronic copy of the Summary Report, please let me know via e-mail (<a href="mailto:annatilman@sympatico.ca">annatilman@sympatico.ca</a>).

                <div class="articleContent">
                    <p>On behalf of the PLRA Board, welcome back returning residents, or if you are new to Percy Lake, we extend our warmest welcome to our beautiful lake and wish you all an enjoyable and pleasant summer with friends and family.</p>
                    <p>While the winter was relatively mild and somewhat erratic, in late March, ice on the lake re-formed after a snow storm, delaying the onset of spring and a build-up of ice on the lake. Some docks did get “twisted” or shifted as a result. Also, a number of major trees on the large island fell, potentially due to a wind storm. Otherwise, on the surface at least, things seem fairly normal, at least for the loons.</p>
                    <p>Over the winter of 2016, PLRA, along with the Haliburton Lake Cottagers’ Association (HLCA) and the Fort Irwin Residents’ Association (FIRA), have been involved in a number of issues and meetings dealing with municipal and provincial issues that affect our common area, including road conditions, the status of the West Bay Landfill, and lake protection programs. We do expect to see some work on improving the roads. Also, we were assured that the Landfill will continue to operate as it currently does, and that we would be consulted regarding any changes that would be made regarding waste disposal and landfills in the municipality.</p>
                    <p>We have also been examining a new permitting process introduced in Ontario this year by the Ministry of Natural
                    Resources & Forestry (MNRF). This process requires property owners in Ontario to obtain authorization from MNRF for the construction or placement of docks and ramps, decks and boathouses that occupy more than 15 square metres (approximately 161 square feet) of shore lands.</p>
                    <p>This is an important issue for many property owners, lake associations, and also municipalities which have bylaws pertaining to these structures. PLRA and other lake associations, along with the Federation of Cottagers’ Association (FOCA) have written to the Minister of MNRF over their concerns regarding this new process and its implications.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">Upcoming Events This Summer</p>
                    <p>For a relatively small association, we do have a number of important events, informative and social, this summer. So mark your calendars accordingly, and plan on your family and friends joining in, and participating in, these three events.</p>

                            <p>The AGM for this year will be held at the FIRA Hall. Our featured guest speaker and presenter will be James Rogers, Forest Conservation Officer for the County of Haliburton. James has a keen interest in managing invasive species and long term forest health and has been involved with several projects addressing these growing concerns in recent years.</p>
                            <p>His presentation will cover the top four invasive forest insect pests, their potential threats, and strategies to reduce further spread. He will also provide a brief overview of the Shoreline Tree Preservation by-law.</p>
                            <p>In addition to James, Dysart Township’s Reeve Murray Fearrey, and Walt Mckechnie, Councillor Ward 5, and an OPP community representative will be on hand.</p>

                            <p>Two students from the Environmental Science program at Trent University will be studying our shoreline and providing confidential and private feedback to property owners on the health of their shoreline. Shorelines, often referred to as

                            <p>The students will be making their observations from boats and we will be needing boat drivers over a three to four day
                            period August 15-19. We have been informed that if all possible, pontoon boats are preferable. Also, we are required to billet the two students while they are here.

                    <p class="subheading">PLRA Membership - Reminder</p>
                    <p>The annual PLRA membership fee is a modest $30 per family. A reminder to renew and/or join PLRA was sent out a couple weeks ago, so this is another reminder of the value of joining PLRA.</p>
                    <p>These fees pay our major expenses, including membership in organizations including Coalition of Haliburton Property Owners’ Association (CHA), the Federation of Ontario Cottagers’ Associations (FOCA), and the Coalition for Equitable Water Flow (CEWF).</p>
                    <p>These fees also pay for expenses incurred by PLRA’s annual events, such as the Annual General Meeting, the Corn Roast and BBQ event, and for this year, some of the costs for the Love Your Lake program that benefits all property owners.</p>
                    <p>A membership form is included for your convenience. Payment can be made by Interac e-transfer or by cheque to PLRA. We are requesting that you fill out the form and send it to our treasurer, Errol Farr, at <a href="mailto:efarr001@me.com">efarr001@me.com</a> (along with your membership fee).</p>

                        <h4>Percy Lake Update</h4>
                        <p class="date">Summer, 2015</p>
                        <p class="author">Anna Tilman</p>
                    </div>
                    <a href="assets/newsletters/pdf/2015newsletter.pdf" role="button" target="_blank" class="button">PDF</a>
                </div>
                <div class="articleContent">
                    <p>As of October 2014, I took on the role of President of the Percy Lake Ratepayers’ Association (PLRA). While PLRA is a relatively small organization, this is a big responsibility and one that I very much enjoy. I trust that I can represent permanent residents and cottagers on Percy Lake with the same dedication as past presidents Graham Warren and Jack Russel and all others who have served in this function over the years.</p>
                    <p>While spring was a long time coming and ice on the lake lingered on well into late April, following a rather harsh and cold winter, fortunately there have been no major incidents similar to those of the previous winter. Some docks did break loose, which is unfortunately a typical problem, and when noticed impacted residents were contacted and informed.</p>
                    <p>On behalf of the PLRA Board, we welcome back returning residents, and if you are new to Percy Lake, we extend our
                    warmest welcome to our beautiful lake. I wish you all an enjoyable and pleasant summer with friends and family.</p>
                    <p>Percy Lake holds a special meaning for us. It is a place for various activities - swimming, boating, fishing, biking, hiking, enjoying nature, as well as caring for and repairing our cottages, but most importantly, a place for peace and reflection, especially during the early morning and evening.</p>
                    <p>We treasure what it has to offer, and care about protecting the health and environment of the lake and the natural habitat that abounds. In that respect, the PLRA and its executive seek to play an important role in communicating with members about various issues pertaining to Percy Lake and its environs, and also to serve as a recipient of residents’ concerns.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we are attentive to municipal issues related to roads, landfill, taxes, etc., and provincial matters of general and specific interest to us, including Hydro and other matters.</p>
                    <p>Our Association is a member of the Coalition of Haliburton Property Owners’ Association (CHA) <a href="http://www.cohpoa.org" target="_blank">www.cohpoa.org</a>, the Federation of Ontario Cottagers’ Associations (FOCA) <a href="http://foca.on.ca" target="_blank">www.foca.on.ca</a>, and the Coalition for Equitable water Flow (CEWF) <a href="http://cewf.typepad.com" target="_blank">www.cewf.typepad.com</a>. These organizations provide valuable information on protecting healthy and sustainable waterfronts and several of our members have attended their meetings and workshops. This involvement gives us an opportunity to communicate with other associations and also ensures we are kept up-to-date on issues that affect us all.</p>
                    <p>A particular concern that continues to emerge relating to stressors on the lake, is the impact of septic systems. The PLRA will be looking into this matter and providing information and advice as to what actions could be taken to ensure that our septic systems are not impinging on groundwater and the lake. The CHA’s website provides excellent information on issues regarding septic systems and recommendations on actions that should be taken to ensure these systems are operating properly, including the embedded video “Poop Talk” that provides guidance on responsible septic use.</p>
                    <p>On another matter, this spring, starting in the end of May through mid-June, many of us noted intense streams of pollen in several areas of the lake and poor water clarity. Additionally, a very foul odour emanated from the water and for some of us the nasty odour prevailed in the water system in our cottages. Because the amount of pollen was excessive at this time this year and believed to be greater than in previous years, there was sufficient concern to warrant checking into this matter.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, Jack Russel contacted David D. Flowers, Management Biologist with the Ministry of Natural Resources, who informed him that we were most likely witnessing a breakdown of pollen and algae growth, which is typical when pollen appears in large quantities on the water.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, this is seasonal in nature and has been reported on a number of lakes in Haliburton County this year. We were assured that it is not of concern, which was a tremendous relief.</p>
                    <p>If you do notice any situation that is “irregular”, or anything of concern to you affecting the lake and its
                    surroundings, please feel free to contact me or any other member of PLRA’s Board, so that we can further investigate the situation.</p>

                    <img src="assets/newsletters/fiftenPaintingTwo.jpg" alt="Lake and fish painting by Mick Tilman">
                    <p>Last year on August 16 we held our Fishing Tournament and Corn Roast, BBQ and silent auction on the beach at the Winder family cottage. This year, we are planning to have the Corn Roast and BBQ again at the same location on the afternoon of Saturday, August 15.</p>
                    <p>From 8 am until noon that same day, our fun and exciting annual Fishing Tournament will take place. These events, rain or shine, have proven to be great fun and provide a wonderful opportunity for everyone to socialize and we look forward to them again.</p>
                    <p>The next PLRA Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, August 1, at Bernie’s
                    Circle, just off Percy Lake Road. Guest speakers will include Dysart Township’s Reeve, Murray Fearrey, and Walt
                    McKechnie, Councillor. The AGM is a time where questions can be raised for our elected officials and is a great
                    opportunity to get to know your neighbours.</p>
                    <p>Please mark this date in your calendar – and bring a chair (or two)! Hopefully the weather will cooperate – and if not, we will find an alternate location and let you know.</p>

                    <p>The fee for joining is a modest $30 per family. A major portion of our revenue goes to pay annual membership fees to organizations including FOCA, CHA and CEWF, that together keep us apprised of developments across Haliburton and Ontario, and lobby on our behalf.</p>

                    <p class="subheading">President's Message</p>
                    <p><span>My first full year as President</span> of the Percy Lake Ratepayers’ Association was a busy one and I can only say it made me even more appreciative of the work done by Jack Russel and his predecessors who have taken on the role in the past and served for several seasons. Our team accomplished a great deal in 2013 and we look forward to a great summer season in 2014.</p>
                    <p>Last year we saw major weather changes, beginning with the late and sudden thaw and extensive rainfall of April 2013, resulting in a wash out on Haliburton Lake Road, devastating floods in Minden and for Percy Lake, historically high water levels. The boating season was late to begin, with many residents unable to get docks and boats into the water until late in May and as late as June for some. Brian Edey has provided some details on water levels and our lake’s role in the Trent-Severn Waterway in his article on page 5. A pleasant summer followed, with intense heat in June, then seasonal temperatures into the fall. Winter was one of the most severe in decades and I invite you to read Jim Richert’s Round-Up on page 3 where he shares some statistics relating to the snow and cold temperatures we both endured and embraced.</p>
                    <p>This year ice out was on May 2nd, the latest in years, but summer quickly arrived following a very short spring. Summer is always an exciting time and this year will be no exception, with the new development on the lake proceeding and looking forward to welcoming new neighbours. Jim Richert has provided more details on next steps for the development on page 7.</p>
                    <p>Our Corn Roast and Fishing Derby proved to be a great success once again in 2013 and thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make it a success. Please see Karen Hatch’s article on the Corn
                    Roast on page 6 and Jim Richert’s update on last year’s Fishing Derby and how to get involved this year in his
                    Round-Up.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to everyone on the PLRA Executive who work together to make our days on Percy more fun and engaging. Our current Executive consists of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Graham Warren; President</li>
                        <li>Karen Hatch; Vice-President and Newsletter Editor</li>
                        <li>Errol Farr; Treasurer</li>
                        <li>Susan Wenghofer; Secretary</li>
                        <li>Jack Russel; Government Relations Director</li>
                        <li>Lou Kiriakiou; Director-at-Large and Newsletter Publishing</li>
                        <li>Bob Wong; Director-at-Large and Newsletter Art Director</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>This year, we’ve decided to shake things up a bit and we will be holding our Annual General Meeting (AGM) immediately following our fishing derby on Saturday, August 16. We will elect our Executive Board members at the AGM, so if you are interested in joining this great team, I invite you to contact me directly and I would be happy to outline the duties involved. We will also have Murray Fearrey our Reeve in attendance and other interesting guests.</p>
                    <p>Immediately following the AGM, we invite you to once again partake in the hospitality so kindly provided by the Winder family and get together for our annual community celebration where we hold a Corn Roast and barbecue on the beach at their cottage. The Corn Roast is complimentary for all current Percy Lake Ratepayers Association members.</p>
                    <p>That naturally leads me to remind everyone to renew your membership in the Percy Lake Ratepayers’ Association (PLRA) and if you haven’t joined in the past, invite all seasonal and permanent residents to become new members. This year our membership fees will be $30 per family, following many years of no increases, despite steeply rising Association costs. Following our incorporation we have secured appropriate insurance coverage, with the result that the associated premiums have significantly increased our annual expenditures. Holding liability insurance is critical to enable activities like the Corn Roast. Additionally, a major expense is our annual membership fee paid to the Federation of Ontario Cottagers’ Association (FOCA) and other associations, including the Coalition of Haliburton Property Owners’ Associations (CHA) and the Coalition for Equitable Water Flow (CEWF). These organizations lobby on our behalf on important issues such as water flow and water quality, land use as well as overall environmental, wildlife and safety concerns, to name but a few, and keep us apprised on developments across Haliburton county and Ontario.</p>
                    <p>If our membership in these associations hasn’t fully convinced you to join, here are the key reasons why joining the PLRA benefits us all:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attend PLRA sponsored events such as the AGM, Corn Roast and Fishing Derby and meet your neighbours and discuss issues of importance.</li>
                        <li>Receive the PLRA newsletter.</li>
                        <li>Inclusion in our PLRA email distribution for updates throughout the year.</li>
                        <li>Receive valuable discounts through our membership in FOCA</li>
                        <li>Discounted cottage and watercraft insurance through Cade Associates, our insurance partner.</li>
                        <li>Complimentary access to FOCA events on important topics such as Cottage Succession Planning</li>

                        <p class="subheading">Tom The Trout</p>
                        <p>As I was stumbling over the snowy patches along the shoreline back in April when we first returned from Arizona, I noticed my buddy Tom the Trout slipping around on top of an ice flow - I was worried he might be in trouble so I asked him how his winter was going.</p>
                        <p>“Well, .. I’ve got some good news and bad news. I’m so darn lucky to be alive - with all the threats to my existence on this planet. Did you know that only 1% of the lakes in Ontario are lake trout lakes and these lakes represent 1/4 of the world’s lake trout lakes? I only know that because I’ve got a super smart fishy friend called Dr. Casselman who has studied me and my buddies here in Haliburton.</p>
                        <p>Now, here’s the bad news!! My little cousin Thomasina lives 4 reeds down from me and is facing a very scary future. She will probably lose her thousands of babies and could lose her own life as well in August or September. She’ll be weaker than a piece of cooked spaghetti after saving up her energy for all those wee little babies and won’t be able to save herself from the anglers. Maybe if you humans stopped fishing mid-August for lake trout our numbers might increase and you’d have more fish to catch next summer. I’ve noticed when you have your fishing derby, you take a picture, then put the trout back in the lake; that’s great for our family and we really appreciate it!“</p>
                        <p>I like your idea Tom! This little fish is one smart swimmer. I hope he has a great summer!</p>
                        <p>as told to his Friend,</p>
                        <p>Susan Russel</p>

                        <p><span>As spring has quickly</span> come and gone and summer is here, it’s time to take both a look back and a glimpse forward. We saw some great spirit and lots of participants in activities here at Percy Lake and look forward to more fun and fellowship in 2014!</p>
                        <p>One-day Fishing Derby and Summer Angling Contest</p>
                        <p>Each year we have two contests to celebrate the angling skills of Percy Lake families. There is an ongoing contest that encompasses the entire season and a one-day fishing derby.</p>
                        <p>For our Summer Angling contest, we had some impressive entries and we will be presenting trophies to deserving anglers, both young and young-at-heart, at our upcoming Annual General Meeting. We had more adults participate in 2013 than in 2012 when we re-established the adult contest and I’d love to see more kids participate this year, as our youth participation was down somewhat in 2013.</p>
                        <p>For our one-day Fishing Derby, Lou Kiriakou is the organizer and this is a wonderful, fun event. It will be held on the morning of Saturday, August 16, followed by our AGM and then the annual Corn Roast and Barbecue. This Derby includes a big trophy presentation; lots of fish stories and plenty of fun are guaranteed from this event.</p>
                        <p>Rules and regulations for both contests are available in the appendix to this Newsletter. If you have any questions, you can email <a href="mailto:lou.kiriakou@sympatico.ca">lou.kiriakou@sympatico.ca</a> for details.</p>
                        <p class="bold">Winter 2013/2014</p>
                        <p>This is certainly a winter that anyone who spent time in Haliburton will not forget! Conditions for snowmobiling, snowshoeing and for both cross country and downhill skiing were superb. In fact, avid snowmobilers say we had the best conditions in over 20 years!</p>
                        <p>Ice covered Percy Lake starting before Christmas, growing to over 30” (76.2cm) thick in February. Pickup trucks were spotted on Haliburton Lake to access ice huts for what proved to be a very long ice fishing season.</p>
                        <p>Looking back, the early snow in November was a clue to get ready, as it snowed nearly every day in December through early January, with nightly temperatures at minus 25-35°C degrees for nearly three consecutive weeks. Furnaces and wood stoves burned full tilt to minimize goose bumps and make cottages cozy, as propane and fuel oil trucks were spotted making frequent deliveries.</p>
                        <p>The snow continued all winter, with a total winter accumulation of 150” (381cm) as recorded by the Douglas family, who are Percy Lake’s own version of Environment Canada, measuring and recording snowfall rates for many years.</p>
                        <p class="bold">Winter Wildlife and Fishing</p>
                        <p>Last year we commented about the apparent decline of the deer population during the winter months and unfortunately the trend appears to be continuing based on even fewer observation reports this past winter. The high snow depth hindered deer standing on their hind legs reaching for cedar as winter food. There was an increase in wolf spotting on the roadways and on the lakes and on very clear nights, Percy Lake was the scene of a serenade as wolves could be heard calling to each other in their distinctive and soulful voices. Tracks were often spotted from lake access trails and driveways to roads as the wolves were scouting for their next meal. Is the increase in wolf sightings potentially a sign that wolves are becoming less fearful of man?</p>
                        <p>Percy was a popular spot for ice fishing this year as holes were drilled at favorite locations and several Lake Trout in the 3-6 pound range were caught on our lake.</p>
                        <p>Helpful Hint: Ensure you have the right fuel for your boat!</p>
                        <p>Don’t forget to purchase premium 91 octane for your marine motors, as it has less ethanol and keeps the motor repair doctor away.</p>
                        <p>Have a great summer and enjoy our beautiful lake!</p>

                        <p>A Book Review by Karen Hatch</p>
                        <p><span>When Fenelon Falls,</span> by Dorothy Ellen Parker, Coach House Books, October 2010, 300 pages, Trade Paperback; $21.95, ebook; $9.99.</p>
                        <p><span>For fun and inspiration</span> I Googled “Canadian cottage novel” and the first hit I got was a blog post featuring Dorothy Ellen Parker’s debut, When Fenelon Falls, set at the fictitious March family compound near Rosedale village on Balsam Lake in the summer of 1969. I anticipated a gentle, nostalgic stroll down memory lane, but instead Parker looks at the darker side of the “Summer of Love” when being just a little bit different was unacceptable in an Ontario that was relentlessly white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, able-bodied and straight and when vicious bullying was characterized as just a little good-natured teasing. The protagonist is a 14-year-old brainy girl named Jordan, a trendy, popular girl’s name today, but very unusual then, who has a slight disability for which she is forced to wear ugly orthopedic shoes. She is the adopted daughter of one of the March brothers and his wife, and the story is narrated by her older non-adopted brother, who makes it clear this is her story, not his. Jordan has done the math and counts back nine months from her date of birth, imagining her October 1954 conception occurred on the exact day when Hurricane Hazel devastated Toronto. Her 1955 birth long pre-dates open adoption and her funny and poignant vignettes where she fantasizes about potential birth parents are sprinkled throughout the novel, as she imagines John F. Kennedy and Queen Elizabeth, (not as a couple, by any means) amongst other famous and not-so-famous individuals as candidates.</p>
                        <p>A famous quote attributed to various 60s icons, “If you remember the 60s you weren’t really there,” suggests an era of revolution and drug use, but for younger Boomers and older Gen X-ers, the 60s were quite simply the decade of our childhood. Parker is note perfect on the pop cultural references and summoned memories of great music, goofy clothes and bad food, as well as the mere six TV channels we had in Toronto when I was a child. Extraordinary to me was the fact that so much happened in the broader world in the less than two-month period when the novel is set; Ted Kennedy’s ill-fated Chappaquiddick drive and Neil Armstrong’s moon walk actually occurred on the same July weekend, with the Manson murders and Woodstock each following within weeks. Imagine the coverage in the current era of 24/7 cable news, Twitter and the blogosphere. But as the novel suggests, to a kid in Ontario in 1969 those events were secondary to what pop song was moving up the CHUM chart. Parallel to Jordan’s story is that of a bear named Yogi, pitifully kept in a cage in Rosedale for the entertainment of locals and people passing through on Highway 35 and remarkably, according to Parker, based on a real caged black bear. Overall, the book is intriguing and well paced, but in my opinion the characters of the nasty March relatives, including Jordan’s parents, could have been more nuanced, the analogy of the adolescent girl to the caged bear was somewhat heavy-handed and the book’s ending a tad contrived. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the novel and found it to be reminiscent of Douglas Coupland’s style, with its spot-on cultural references and upbeat pop music soundtrack, coupled with its cast of idiosyncratic characters, insider family jokes and commentary of the punning March clan. If you do remember the 60s, or if you weren’t even born then but are looking for something just a little bit different, give When Fenelon Falls a try. It’s available at both the Toronto and Haliburton Public Libraries, or for online purchase as an eBook.</p>

                        <p class="subheading">Lake Levels Update and Report</p>
                        <p>Brian Eddy</p>
                        <p><span>The Coalition for Equitable Water Flow (CEWF)</span> Annual General Meeting was held during September at the Haliburton Fish Hatchery and I was the PLRA’s representative. The floods from the Spring of 2013 were a painful and recent memory, so the meeting was well-attended and lively. Key topics included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Review of the flood response detailed report. The report developed by engineering consultant AECOM, included data on historic rainfall patterns, snow pack and lake levels, including those recorded just before the April 18, 2013 flood. The key takeaways from the session were;</li>
                            <li>The authorities have a less than desirable capability to manage floodwater.</li>
                            <li>Flood response capability decreases as the freshet (spring thaw resulting from snow and ice melt) continues and the lakes fill.</li>
                            <li>The Trent Severn Waterway (TSW) does not have a constraint-based model for the reservoir lakes, of which Percy is one.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The 2011 AECOM report on Water Management to the TSW was discussed and subsequent to the meeting was posted. This study is really heavy reading, however, the top takeaway, buried on page 42 in the Water Management Manual, is a really interesting graph of the nominal dates for dam operations.</p>
                        <p>An issue raised at the meeting was the out-dated information on the TSW lake level web site, particularly the historic high/low numbers, which has been addressed with the inclusion of updated data from 2008-2013. Parks Canada through its agency, the TSW, manages our lake level using removable timbers (logs) on our dam leading into the Gull River. This past winter, Percy had one log in place, compared to two in the past. As a result, the winter minimum level decreased by the height of one log, or 0.3m.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For 2014, the CEWF priority remains an Integrated Approach to Water Management at the Watershed Level. One of the 17 conclusions from the flood response was that the TSW doesn’t focus on minimizing ice damage. In March Parks Canada announced Federal investment in the TSW of $58 million. Interestingly, they didn’t release a report on dam safety that suggests the need for further spending.</li>
                            <li>Fall lake ‘bounce’. This will be a topic at our AGM. (Editor’s note; I don’t think this has anything to do with installing a trampoline on the spit, but who knows? Come to the AGM and find out.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="bold">Forecast 2014 Lake Level for Percy</p>
                        <p>The winter of 2013/14 saw a more sustained snow pack and lower temperatures than in past 5-8 years. The sustained cold delayed the spring melt and the traditional addition of logs to the dam by nearly a month. Despite these issues, 2014 flooding was well downstream in the Kawartha Lakes, on Chemong and Scugog, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources.It appears that Percy returned to a level that was somewhat higher than we have experienced in recent years in the spring, however, not as high as the record level of 2013.</p>

                        <p>Karen Hatch</p>
                        <p><span>The annual Percy Lake Corn Roast</span> and Community BBQ was held at the Winder’s cottage in August and once again was a great success. First of all, thanks to Harry and Sylvia Winder for their kindness and hospitality! Your consideration and generosity have enabled us to have this fun, family get-together for three years in a row and all Percy Lake residents really appreciate your thoughtfulness.</p>
                        <p>This event just keeps getting better and better. The PLRA executive, the Winder family and volunteers generously give both time and energy, preparing delicious corn (both roasted and boiled) and yummy hot dogs for all members free of charge, with our neighbours bringing fabulous salads and desserts to round out the buffet for a scrumptious summer feast. The mid-August timing couldn’t be better! The bugs aren’t bugging us too much, the late afternoon skies are clear and warm, back-to-school is still a few weeks away and I can assure you if you haven’t attended, it’s a wonderful way to re-acquaint yourself with old friends and to meet new neighbours, as everyone is relaxed and having a wonderful time.</p>
                        <p>One of the highlights of the event is the announcement of the winners of the Fishing Derby and the presentation of the trophy to the winning team. And at our 2013 event, the young people on the lake added a sandcastle building contest and there were some pretty impressive results, I must say!</p>
                        <p>Please join us on Saturday, August 16 for our 4th annual Corn Roast and Barbecue at approximately 4:00 pm, immediately following the AGM. We will be holding the event at the Winder’s beach once again and all PLRA members are invited to attend. Delicious corn will be served, accompanied by barbecued hot dogs, all provided by the PLRA. Each family is asked to bring either a salad or dessert. All PLRA members, families and their weekend houseguests are welcome to attend and I guarantee you will have a great time!</p>

                        <p>Jim Richert with information from John Parish</p>
                        <p><span>Throughout 2013,</span> we saw significant progress on the new Percy and Haliburton Lake lots from Greif developments. Phase 1 on Percy Lake saw the most activity with Hydro and Bell infrastructure complete, enabling construction to begin on two lots. There are plans in place for a cottage on an additional lot this summer and of the 15 lots, seven are now sold.</p>
                        <p>Last summer we also saw the release of a total of 13 new lots; nine of the lots are on Percy Lake and four are on Haliburton Lake, but all are accessed via Percy Lake Road. Four lots sold quickly, with construction planned for one lot this summer. Look forward to Hydro and Bell installation for these lots soon.</p>
                        <p>This summer we will also see the development of 18 lots on Haliburton Lake, accessed via Hodgson Road south of Fort Irwin. Road construction is now complete and the developer is awaiting final sub-division approval, anticipating sales commencing in mid-summer 2014. We will also see the commencement of Phase III of the Percy Lake development, with approximately 36 lots, along with a further 22 lots on Haliburton Lake. Roads are currently under construction for both of these developments, but it is unknown when the lots will be available for purchase.</p>
                        <p>If you or someone you know is interested, lot prices start at $185,000.

                    <p class="subheading">President's Message</p>
                    <p><span>Hello everyone</span> and welcome back to cottage season! I’m Graham Warren and I am delighted to have been selected as your new President of the Percy Lake Ratepayers’ Association. For those of you who don’t know me, my cottage is on Percy Lake Road, near the end, and I have been enjoying our lake for 19 years now. I have been the PLRA Treasurer for many years and am now looking forward to representing you as the President of our association.</p>
                    <p>I have very large shoes to fill in my new role and on behalf of all residents of Percy, I want to express my most sincere thanks to Jack Russel for his tireless work on our behalf. Jack has been our President since late 2009 and has done so much for all of us, working together with our municipal government to ensure our voice is heard in local affairs. He has also increased social and community activities, and was the catalyst behind launching the annual Corn Roast and Fishing Derby. Jack has been supported in all of his efforts by his wife Susan, whose boundless energy and enthusiasm are greatly appreciated by all of us who have the pleasure to work with her. Fortunately, Jack will be remaining on the Board, to provide expertise and support, moving forward. Jack has assumed the role of Director, Government Relations, and will continue to work with local elected officials and public servants to ensure our voice is heard. Susan is stepping down from the Board, but continues to provide support and counsel. Thanks to both Jack and Susan.</p>
                    <p>New to the Board as Vice-President is Karen Hatch, who is enjoying her fourth season as a cottager and is on Johnson Bay Road. Errol Farr is taking over my previous duties as Treasurer and Susan Wenghofer will be taking over from Susan Russel as Secretary. Rounding out the team, we have Brian Edey, Lou Kiriakou, Jim Richert, Jim Shephard, Dave Smith, Anna Tilman and Bob Wong as independent Directors, providing help in areas such as newsletter production and organizing community events.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Highlights from 2012 and Plans for 2013</p>
                    <p>PLRA is now incorporated, thanks to the efforts of the Board. This is an important change, as we face more complex issues and address the liability of serving on a Board, no matter how small. In particular, the handover of the land that includes the “spit” (public beach on the lower part of the lake) has been completed and this land is now the responsibility of our organization. During the summer months we saw more usage of the spit. Unfortunately, this included overnight camping which is not permitted, despite signs posted to communicate that information. We therefore added additional signage and alerted local authorities to a particularly flagrant violation, which was handled appropriately. Signs have also been erected on the islands, indicating overnight camping and fires are prohibited. Of course, everyone is welcome to picnic and enjoy themselves, however, all food and garbage must be removed and no one may stay overnight. Jim Richert has more updates for us in his feature, Richert’s Roundup, which captures some of the highlights of 2012.</p>
                    <p>As for 2013, it will be exciting to finally see the first of the new lots developed and we are looking forward to welcoming new neighbours to our beautiful lake. Once again, we will be hosting our annual Corn Roast and Fishing Derby and we invite everyone to attend. Our Annual General Meeting will occur on Sunday, June 30th at 10:00 a.m. and will again be held outdoors just off Percy Lake Road, past the Johnson Bay Road at Bernie’s Circle. We will be joined by our Reeve Murray Fearrey, Councillor Walt McKechnie, and possibly Paul MacInnes of the CHA (Coalition of Haliburton Property Associations) to do a presentation on lake stressors. I very much hope to see everyone there.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Have a great summer and see you around the lake!</p>

                        <p>Brian Eddy</p>
                        <p><span>Percy Lake residents</span> are well aware that as a headwater lake for the Trent Severn Waterway system (TSW), our lake experiences significant variations in water levels throughout the year. The dam on the Gull River is used to manage the lake levels through a system of removable timbers (logs), managed by the TSW, which is in turn under the auspices of Parks Canada. Concerns raised by residents from a variety of headwater lakes and rivers in Haliburton County led to the formation of the Coalition for Equitable Water Flow (CEWF), a volunteer lobbying group that represents resident concerns relating to issues with both low and fluctuating water levels on member waterways. The CEWF mandate is to have a voice within TSW relating to not only the concern that low water levels negatively impact property values and recreational pursuits, but also that continually changing water levels have a detrimental impact on shoreline ecology.</p>
                        <p>The CEWF approached all member residents’ associations and asked for input into an official policy statement on preferred water levels. This issue is of heightened concern this spring due to the unprecedented flooding and the washout of the Haliburton Lake Road on April 19th. The position of the PLRA, as voted on at last summer’s Annual General Meeting, is to strive for less volatility by ensuring a more even approach to managing the water flow. Quite simply, this would be accomplished by removing the dam logs on a more gradual basis, decreasing the sharp drop-offs in water levels we have historically experienced in the late summer and fall.</p>
                        <p>This is a complex question and we therefore recommend you visit the CEWF website at www.cewf.ca to learn more about this important issue. Brian Edey will take some time at this summer’s AGM to explain the issues and present an update on our official position. Should you wish to discuss this directly with Brian prior to the meeting, please feel free to contact him directly at <a href="mailto:brian_edey@rogers.com">brian_edey@rogers.com</a>.</p>

                        <p class="subheading">Tom The Trout</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">As I was walking</span> along the shoreline the other day, I realized my buddy Tom was under the ice and unable to sun himself as he likes to do in early Spring. Sadly, I returned to our cottage and read some emails - I noticed that one popped up from Tom. Here’s what he had to say:</p>
                        <p>Thanks so much for not using those yucky high-powered cleaners to wash your toilets (especially that blue stuff).
                        Things are looking up for some of my friends. The other day we were lamenting the fact that we are still under this
                        thick sheet of ice, so we decided to visit the fish nursery along the shoreline. My fishy-daycare worker friends were
                        giving us old trout some good advice about our shorelines on Percy.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">“Keep it Natural!”</span> they were telling us.</p>
                        <p>Here’s some other good advice they gave us:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don’t mow your grass down to the water - Maintain a pathway for access to the water but keep development at least 30 metres from the shoreline.</li>
                            <li>Maintain a buffer zone of native plants along the shoreline - it will slow erosion, provide food for the little fish, shelter for other animals and wildlife and protect the HUMAN properties. It also means less work for those cottagers - they can get out and enjoy us, and the lake.</li>
                            <li>Tell your cottage friends that keeping the shoreline natural will protect their property and investment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I emailed Tom right back and thanked him for his note - I look forward to seeing him along our NATURAL shorelines come Spring. (Spring will come - I saw the first robin today.)</p>
                        <p>Oh-Fishily Yours, Susan Russel</p>

                        <p>Jim Richert</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">There’s been so much</span> happening on Percy Lake over the past year. We’ve got a lot to be proud of and a great deal to look forward to, as cottage season is now upon us. The new lots are now being actively sold and construction is beginning. It will be interesting to see the development unfold and welcome new cottagers to our lake. Our annual Angling Contest was a great success and we invite new and returning anglers to try their luck this summer. Finally, winter threw us some curves this year; it arrived late, left briefly, and then felt like it would never end!</p>
                        <p class="bold">New Development on Percy and Haliburton Lakes: Greif Shoreline Development Project</p>
                        <p>Development continues on the new lots and we are seeing progress - in fact, construction has actually begun on two lots. Phase I, which includes 15 lots, starts at the end of Johnson Bay Road. These lots are currently on the market, represented by John and Marj Parish and Lots 3, 4, 8, 11 and 13 have been sold. Site clearing has been undertaken on Lot 13 and a foundation is now in place. It is understood that construction will commence on one of the other lots immediately.</p>
                        <p>Phase II will start at the end of Percy Lake Road and continue past the dam towards Haliburton Lake. This phase includes lots on both Percy and Haliburton Lakes. It is expected that realtor signs will appear this spring with anticipated Hydro and Bell service completed this fall.</p>
                        <p>Phase III will be south of the Gull River and accessed by road from Fort Irwin past the public beach. This past winter road construction indicated the first steps in preparing this area for development. This phase includes 8 of 40 lots on the east shore of Haliburton Lake and it is anticipated these will be available for purchase in the fall.</p>
                        <p class="bold">Annual Angling Contest</p>
                        <p>Once again we had a great turnout for the 2012 Angling Contest. Everyone had a great time and there were definitely some impressive catches! Check out plra.net for pictures and fish length entered for both the youth and adult annual Angling Contest. Winners will be announced and trophies presented at the AGM this summer.</p>
                        <p>We will be continuing the tradition in 2013, so brush up on the angler eligibility and rules at plra.net and don’t be shy to show off your catch, especially entries and pictures in the youth category. Remember both youth and adult trophies are awarded for bass and lake trout. A 22.5” lake trout caught through the ice in March has already been submitted by an adult.</p>
                        <p class="bold">2013 Bass Tournament</p>
                        <p>Check the rules at plra.net, as this is a one day tournament usually scheduled on the date of the Annual Lake Corn Roast. The date and time will be announced soon!</p>
                        <p class="bold">Winter 2012/2013</p>
                        <p>Below freezing temperatures and snowflakes generally signify the winter season has arrived. Well, Mother Nature kept us guessing this past season as snow arrived in December, melted in January, followed by steady snow accumulations and cold temperatures resuming mid-February through early March, plus an additional 6.0 inches in April. According to Douglas’s snow meter, a total snow blanket of 126.5 inches landed at Percy Lake this year. This is much less accumulation than previous years according to the score keeper. After the snow arrived in February and March they were active months for snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and hiking. Many tracks from these sports were visible on the lake and along the portage from Percy to Haliburton Lakes.</p>
                        <p>An intriguing mystery this winter was “Who plowed that driveway?” This question traveled around the lake and still remains unanswered. It seems that a ghost vehicle plowed several cottage driveways without being detected. Sincere thanks to the mystery ghost driver, whoever you are!</p>
                        <p>Ice fishing at Thompson Point was a very popular location as weekend anglers augured many holes through thick ice, making the lake look like Swiss cheese. Several anglers caught their lake trout limit, including huge bass that were quickly returned to the water. This could be the year for record for size trout and bass. Let’s keep it up. Get those rods and reels rigged with fresh line and let’s go fishing this summer!</p>
                        <p>I’m curious if anyone else has noticed the gradual decline of deer sightings during the winter months over the last few years. One will occasionally see the odd one or two deer, but the small herds that would roam the shoreline and wander among the cottages in the past have all but disappeared. The biologists attribute the decline to the growing and hungry wolf population. We’re told that this is normal and part of the food chain life cycle and over time the local deer population will increase.</p>
                        <p class="bold">Boat Gasoline Prevent Costly Repairs</p>
                        <p>Just a reminder, regular or 87 octane gasoline contains ethanol. This ingredient has a powerful appetite for moisture and with warm summer days plus cool nights, water condenses inside fuel tanks and is absorbed by the ethanol. Eventually, the gasoline can separate, with a layer that is primarily water in the bottom of the tank. Ouch. Your boat motor is no longer happy.</p>
                        <p>To prevent engine trouble, simply spend a little more per tank for premium or 91 octane ethanol free gasoline. Fort Irwin’s premium 91 octane gasoline is ethanol free. So that’s it from Jim.</p>
                        <p class="special">Welcome back to the cottage and see you on the Lake</p>

                        <p class="subheading">Dockside Reading</p>
                        <p>A Book Review by Karen Hatch</p>
                        <p><span>Stray Bullets,</span> by Robert Rotenberg, Published by Simon & Schuster, 2012 Trade Paperback $16.99.</p>
                        <p><span>Robert Rotenberg</span> is a real-life Toronto-based criminal defense lawyer, who has been called “The John Grisham of Canada”, by international reviewers. His ripped-from-the-headlines legal thrillers are perfect for dockside summer reading. To date, Rob has written four novels, with the most recent Strangle Hold, having just been released on May 6th. His books feature a recurring cast of characters who are members of the Metropolitan Toronto Police homicide squad and the Crown Attorney’s office in Toronto. These characters work together closely, solving crimes and prosecuting the accused. Each of his novels has been reminiscent of a real crime and they are definitely page-turners. The earlier two books, Old City Hall and The Guilty Plea, are both readily available at the public library. It isn’t necessary to read them all in order, however, it does help to better understand some of the character development.</p>
                        <p>Stray Bullets was his third book and was released in 2012. As the story begins, we are presented with a terrifying, yet eerily believable situation. A gunfight erupts in the parking lot of a Tim Hortons donut shop at College and Bay (yes, he actually refers to the shop by name!) and a small boy is tragically killed by a stray bullet. Our hero homicide cops must solve the murder and the Crown Attorneys must ensure the culprits go to jail. Of course, as Rob is a defense attorney, there is room in his books for Grishamesque wrongly accused and framed defendants and crusading defense lawyers. Although some may write his books off as formulaic, I personally find them to be engaging and engrossing. And given the fact that Stray Bullets was released right before the Eaton Centre shooting last summer, there was a scary timeliness to the book.</p>
                        <p>I had the pleasure of meeting Rob at an alumni function where he presented a seminar on “Writing for Business Professionals”. He encouraged us to take the extra time and care to simplify our writing and not rely too heavily on jargon. He joked that business managers are the second worst at writing in an overly complex and confusing fashion, and that lawyers are definitely the worst. Rob is a Haliburton cottager who has done readings at our local library and has put a couple of local references into his books. I asked him if he would set one of his novels in Haliburton cottage country and he pointed out that as much as he would love to do precisely that, it is very difficult, given that his main characters wouldn’t have jurisdiction in Haliburton County. Nevertheless, he did tell me there were a few cottage country mentions in his upcoming books. I look forward to reading Strangle Hold, his newly released book, on my deck at Percy this summer and I’ll be looking for those local references.</p>

                        <p class="subheading">Shoreline Tree Preservation By-Law: What all Residents Need to Know</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Until recently,</span> there were no limitations on tree cutting in Haliburton County. This led to some unfortunate situations where significant numbers of mature trees were completely removed from large areas of shoreline, which is not only unsightly, but also potentially damaging to the ecosystem. The County therefore enacted the Shoreline Tree Preservation By-law No. 3505 to ensure rules and regulations are in place to protect the beauty of our lakes and rivers and maintain a healthy natural environment.</p>
                        <p class="bold">Trees that are Protected</p>
                        <p>The by-law refers to trees with a diameter of 10 cm or more, with the diameter measured 1.37 metres from the ground, that are within 30 metres of the shoreline. If you are unsure if a tree you want to remove is protected, you can consult a professional Qualified Arborist to confirm that the tree needs to be removed, and it is recommended that you take pictures prior to the removal or pruning of trees. If the tree is more than 30 metres from the shore, you do not need a permit to remove it. This new regulation does not alter the existing one that states that you must obtain permission from the local municipality to remove any trees on shoreline currently owned by the municipality.</p>
                        <p class="bold">Exceptions and Relief</p>
                        <p>If a tree has a diameter of less than 10 cm, 1.37 metres from ground level, it can be removed, as can trees that are considered hazardous, are dead, diseased or severely injured. Trees or stumps that interfere with emergency work may be removed and pruning or removal of trees in accordance with professional practices or as authorized under a municipal building permit or very close to a cottage, septic system or driveway, can be removed. Please refer to Section 3 of the Shoreline Tree Preservation By-law No. 3505 for the details of these exemptions. One important exception you need to know is that even when it is permitted to remove a tree, you may have to maintain the stump and/or roots on a steep lot, to prevent erosion.</p>
                        <p class="bold">Enforcement of the Regulations</p>
                        <p>If you suspect someone has removed a tree in violation of the rules, you can contact the County of Haliburton, in writing or by email. If the tree is in the process of removal, County Enforcement staff could order the tree not be removed, and alternatively, if the tree is found to have been removed in violation of the by-law, fines between $500 to $100,000 could be levied and an order issued to re-plant trees to replace the removed trees.</p>

                        <p class="subheading">Shoreline Sheds Update</p>
                        <p><span>As you may</span> already know, due to the lobbying of Jack Russel and former Percy Lake resident and PLRA President Ken Loney, our lake has a special by-law amendment enabling the installation of conforming sheds near the lakeshore. These two gentlemen did all Percy Lake residents a service by explaining to elected officials and civil servants that the steepness of our shores made this amendment a priority as it will ensure our shoreline is kept tidy, by enabling convenient lakeside storage for seasonal items.</p>
                        <p>Here is a quick review of the regulations.</p>
                        <p>Sheds can be constructed within the water setback of 65 feet, if they meet the following criteria:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The lot in question must have a minimum slope of 15% measured over a horizontal distance inland 30 metres from the high water mark;</li>
                            <li>The sheds will be restricted to a maximum ground floor area of 9.3 sq. metres (100 sq. feet) and a maximum height of 3.5 metres (11.5 feet);</li>
                            <li>Each shed must be at least 4 metres (13 feet) from the high water mark and 1 metre (3.3 feet) from the side lot line and screened from view from the lake and from neighbouring lots by native vegetation;</li>
                            <li>Vehicles and motor vehicles (including boats) may not be stored in the sheds, nor may sheds be used for living accommodations of any nature.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If your lot meets the above criteria and you would like to install a shed within the water setback, please ensure you approach the Township to receive both a zoning by-law amendment and a site plan and agreement and you must purchase your shoreline road allowance, if you have not previously done so.</p>
                        <p>Should you wish to construct a shed, please refer to Section 5.1.2, the amendment to the by-law that permits Percy Lake residents on appropriate lots to install sheds within the shoreline allowance. Please contact the Township before you start to build your shed to ensure you are properly following these guidelines.</p>

                        <p class="subheading">Changes Proposed to Work Permits Issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR)</p>
                        <p>Anna Tilman</p>
                        <p>Anna Tilman is concerned about proposed changes that would eliminate the need for work permits issued by the MNR pertaining to certain activities around shoreline dredging, filling and the removal of vegetation on Ontario lakes and rivers. Under the proposed provisions, work permits will no longer be required for activities that are considered to have “minimal or no impact to natural resources or public safety”. Previously, these activities required both an application by the homeowner or commercial entity and a subsequent MNR review. The Ministry states that the proposed changes are in pursuit of modernization and designed to eliminate waste and duplication with other ministries and government agencies. Anna is concerned that the reason for the change is primarily economic and that the new approach could result in a degradation of shoreline integrity as well as being potentially harmful to fish and vegetation habitats.</p>
                        <p>Currently, the issue is in review and closed to public comment, however, Anna directly addressed the Team Lead with her concerns regarding the proposed policy changes during the comment process and is awaiting a response from the MNR. Should you wish to review the proposed “Modernization of Approvals” MNR Initiative, please type “EBR Registry Number: 011-7669” into Google, and you will automatically be directed to the December 12th proposal. Anna would be pleased to circulate the letter to interested fellow residents and discuss the concerns she raised.

                    <p class="subheading">President's Message</p>
                    <p>As we wintered in Arizona, it was hard to imagine Percy Lake being covered with ice and snow. Life on the frozen lake was just waiting to spring forth and provide a feeding ground for mosquitoes and black flies. We wondered if the trees were confused with the erratic weather and if the sap had started to run before we got home to tap the trees, an activity we started last year. There is nothing quite like starting with a slightly sweet watery base and turning it into delicious woody tasting syrup. We arrived home March 15.	The sap ran well until we had a week of hot weather – I was collecting sap in shorts. Now there is definitely something wrong with that picture. We collected about a third of what we obtained last year.</p>
                    <p>This is my last President’s message to you. I will be stepping down as President of the Percy Lake Ratepayers’ Association at the AGM. It is my plan to continue as one of the Directors on the Board. We are searching for a new President and need someone to step up to insure continuity – to date no one has come forward. The Association depends on you. <span class="special">Let me know if you are interested!</span></p>
                    <p>For more than two years, the Board has been in discussions with the township concerning overnight parking at the boat launch and large parties camping on the spit. Last year new signs were posted at the boat launch. This did not deter the occurrence of large camping parties by non-Percy people on the spit. During the late summer and fall of 2011, members of the board met with Murray Fearrey, Walt Mckechnie, the parking by-law enforcement officer, the Chief Administrative Officer for the township, and OPP Staff Sargeant Malcolm Quiqley to talk about our concerns. Further work will be done over the winter and early spring to implement some of the suggestions.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Percy Lake Water Levels - submitted by Brian Edey</p>
                    <p>What is our 'preferred' water level? That's almost a trick question since the level of Percy Lake is varied by the TSW via the Percy Lake outlet dam with 6 12" logs and a 6"bar. The CEWF [Coalition for Equitable Water Flow] has asked Percy Lake and all the Lake Associations for their preferred level profile.</p>

                    <p>For us, the current profile means a rapid rise in the Spring - often while there is ice free to be blown into docks; a steady drop each week from May 24 to Labour day; and then a swift drop of about 1 metre while we are all considering another great weekend before getting boats out and docks and dragged upshore. For those concerned about the trout spawn, that cycle [especially in the Fall] risks a drybed or too deep a cover for the roe; or insufficient wave action on the bed to clean it before the spawning. For those with an interest in water sports the constant change over the summer means new navigation hazards come into play each week-end. So, back to the point, what's 'preferred'?</p>
                    <p>One suggestion is the dotted red line in the picture. Three [3] logs always; Spring rise to six [6] logs after the ice hazard is past; drop back to three[3] logs after Aug 1 and be stable by mid September. That wouldn't be easy; but, that wasn't part of the question. The higher base level would be better for the spawn and wouldn't affect our ability to pull docks out of the water. The delay in raising the level in the Spring would protect the same docks from ice movement damage. A relatively stable level through the boating season would minimize the change to navigation hazards.</p>

                        <p>As I was walking along our shoreline and admiring the beautiful sunlit morning, I noticed my friend, Tom the Trout sunning himself upon a warm rock (his gills were working overtime) and catching a few tasty blackflies with his incredibly quick trout tongue ( a delicacy in some foreign lands- but I didn’t tell him that).</p>
                        <p>“Tom, I said. “How goes it in your neck of the woods?” “Well,he said. “Some of my trout buddies are sick and under the rocks these days with terrible stomach aches. Somebody has been cleaning their toilets with heavy-duty cleaner - the kind with bad chemicals for us trout. The chemicals go through the septic tank and are washing into the lake where me and my buddies drink the water and get sick.”</p>
                        <p>“Hey, Tom! I said. It’s tough knowing what things to use here on the waterfront - I feel bad for your trout friends. These high-powered toilet bowl cleaners cause bacterial contamination that is bad for all living things in the lake. But humans need to have clean toilets - what can we do?”</p>
                        <p>Here is what Tom says:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Borax powder is cheap, a great deodorizer and disinfectant and available at both the Independent and Foodland. Vinegar is good too.</li>
                            <li>Cleaning products that go down the drain and into your septic system need to be non-chlorine, non-amonia, non-antibacterial, non-toxic and biodegradeable.</li>
                            <li>There are lots of “green products” available now. <a href="www.naturecleanliving.com" target="_blank">NatureClean</a> and <a href="www.ecoethic.ca" target="_blank">EcoEthic</a> are just two that are available.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>And finally, Tom says “Too much “green cleaner” is not good either. Use just enough to get the job done.”</p>
                        <p>“Catch Ya Later Tom!” Tom has got to be the smartest fish I have ever known.</p>
                        <p>Oh Fishily yours, Tom The Trout</p>

                        <p>Skinks are not salamanders or short snakes with four legs. Skinks are lizards found throughout North America. A Haliburton skink has five stripes from nose to tail but those stripes fade as the skinks get older (kind of like our memories). Male skinks have bright orange jaws and chins.</p>
                        <p>These small ground dwellers have "Species At Risk" status in Haliburton County. <span class="bold">So, in the interest of species conservation, here are Five-Lives Tips for our friends the skinks:</span></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Always avoid exotic pet hunters: You are Ontario's only lizard and you better hide when unscrupulous folk try to satisfy lizard-longing terrarium owners;</li>
                            <li>Keep a low profile around dogs, cats and raccoons: you are busy predators, snacking endlessly on insects, worms or even other invertebrates but you have to watch out for the 'big guys".</li>
                            <li>Stick to rocky outcroppings in mixed forests of conifers and deciduous trees: loose rocks provide you with nesting and food sources but this habitat also has great hiding spots when needed (see #1 and #2.)</li>
                            <li>Teen skinks should wear camouflage: unlike tattoos, you juveniles have bright blue tails that fade as you age. Sassy teen skinks know those tails detach when pounced on by predators.</li>
                            <li>Wear a sign that says: I'm A Species At Risk in Haliburton County.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>I guess the skinks won't be reading this newsletter. If we want this Species At Risk to survive and thrive, it is up to us. Those cute Inukshuks all over Haliburton County? Those are skink habitats you are messing with. "THINK SKINK" before you move protective loose rocks on the ground.</p>

                    <p class="subheading">President's Message</p>
                    <p>Spring has arrived on Percy! Trilliums have been spotted, buds are on the trees, and soon we will welcome blackflies.
                    Susan and I left Percy December 12 in a snow storm and got home April 6. There are many changes on the lake. One sees
                    For Sale and Sold signs on cottages; new roads are being cut into the forest to accommodate the development, and we say
                    farewell to permanent residents, Ken and Wendy Loney. Winter was short and a disappointment for many who ice fish and
                    love snowmobiling - Ice Out day on April 3 was the earliest I can remember.</p>
                    <p>Your board has been busy over the winter dealing with development issues, shed issues, lake steward issues, and
                    creating a new sign to be placed at the corner of Percy lake Road and Johnson Bay Road. This newsletter will include an
                    update on each of these points along with some special insights into wintering at Percy, the Trent Severn Waterway, the
                    Coalition of Haliburton Property Owners Association, and information about FIRA.</p>
                    <p>RESPECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND OTHERS is prominent on our new Percy Lake Welcome Sign as in our website, <a href="www.plra.net" target="_blank">www.plra.net</a></p>
                    <p>The Percy Lake Watershed Plan states “This is your lake. You need to take ownership of your lake. Preserve and protect
                    the good things, and do your best to ensure that the bad things aren’t allowed to happen.” I think we can all agree
                    with this as I hear many refer to Percy as a bit of paradise. So what does it mean to preserve and protect the good
                    things? And what are the bad things over which we have some control?</p>
                    <p>This winter your PLRA board has devoted hours to working with council on the new Official Plan for Dysart et al. and
                    has lobbied for stiffer bylaws related to clear cutting of trees on newly developed lots.</p>
                    <p>The board also (thanks to Ken Loney and Jim Richert) presented yet again at council concerning the issue of allowing
                    sheds on Percy close to the waterfront. The board has also been kept informed of Development on Percy and the placement
                    of roads at the end of Johnson Bay Road and now at the end of the lake heading towards the dam and Haliburton Lake. And
                    after many years of not testing lake water quality, the board will begin water quality testing under the direction of
                    Susan Russel.</p>
                    <p>The board has also been an active member of the Coalition of Haliburton Property Owners Association (CHPOA) and will be
                    working to create a handbook to be given to new property owners that will introduce them to their lake association and
                    related bylaws.</p>
                    <p>Individually, each of us can have an impact on the good and the bad. We can respect privacy by keeping noise and light
                    pollution down. We can think before we use the lake inappropriately by not bathing in the lake (yes, even the
                    biodegradable soaps are not as completely degradable as we might hope); using the lake for washing tools and vehicles),
                    and insuring our boat motors are working correctly with no gas leakage to name a few things. Many of us do these things
                    without thinking and I myself am guilty. There is much we can do! With more development on the lake, we have more to do
                    to insure that we respect the environment and each other. Please do not hesitate to contact me @ <a href="mailto:jack.susan.russel@gmail.com">jack.susan.russel@gmail.com</a> or 754-9405 if you have any concerns. See you on the lake!</p>

                        <p>Winter started late with “ice in” on December 17 – normally “ice in” is the first week of December. As expected, we
                        experienced a week in January of nightly temperatures at minus 25/30 degrees where oil furnaces and wood stoves were
                        burning full tilt to isolate ole man winter outside. The season ended early from a snow perspective as the last
                        significant snow fall was the second week of February. The total snow accumulation for 2009/10 season was 7.7 feet
                        compared to 13.6 feet the previous 2008/09 winter, and 17plus feet the winter before. The ice has now been out for more
                        than two weeks and I am itching to get the fishing boats and trout tackle ready for some early trolling.</p>
                        <p>The pure white snow blanket, endless visibility unobstructed by leaves and ground foliage, pure blue windless skies
                        make for a picture perfect winter experience at Percy Lake. About mid January the lake ice was good with only slight
                        traces of slush and this made for great snowshoeing, cross country skiing, and snowmobiling conditions. Even the road excavating crew clearing
                        the portage trail cooperated with the recreation activities by keeping the path open and passable.</p>
                        <p>Reports from local and out of town ice fisherman indicated that “tight line & fish catch” activity was off compared to
                        previous years. Some attribute this to the late lake “turn over cycle”, meaning cold water layers sinking like a giant
                        saucer stirring up the bottom, forcing the warmer water to the surface. This turbulence slowed down the formation of
                        safe ice thickness and bottom water remained cloudy affecting fish feeding habits.</p>
                        <p>In past winters, several small groups of deer would travel the shoreline and mingle among cottages, but the numbers
                        were significantly less this year. The occasional fox and moose tracks were spotted along trails and mink traveling the
                        river bank snow looking for the next dinner minnow.</p>
                        <p>Numerous deer kills have been reported in the area. It is common knowledge wolves are the primary predator accounting
                        for a majority of the loss. Local newspapers expressed concern over the growing wolf population, and reduced fear of
                        humans, as loggers working in the bush and others have experienced close encounters by these mammals. Only a few years
                        back one would hear the occasional howling of a wolf pack at night. Now we see wolf prints on paths, along the roadway,
                        in cottage driveways and witness daylight lake crossing. One cottager woke up one morning only to find a dead deer in
                        the drive. The half eaten carcass was removed but for several days following, two wolves reappeared at 4am to harass
                        the pet dog inside the cottage. Eventually they retreated to the bush. It seems we are experiencing first hand the
                        population rise and fall of various mammals due to the natural food availability cycle.</p>

                        <p>Our annual water level swings (steep rise in the Spring and deep drop from June to October) cause property and boat
                        damage, damage fish and wildlife habitat, expose navigation issues, etc. Since Percy is a headwater lake in the
                        reservoir system, we are in the group with the greatest level swings (~2m).</p>
                        <p>When the Federal Government opened the door to comment via their ‘study on the future of the TSW,’ cottage associations
                        banded together to respond. That initiated the creation of the Coalition for Equitable Water Flow as a single voice.
                        (It has an interesting web site.)</p>
                        <p>The official action plan from the Federal Government in response to their study was to creat the Water management
                        Advisory Council on the TSW. It has a role to provide expert and stakeholder advice to Parks Canada on how to better
                        carry out its responsibilities for water management and includes two representatives from Haliburton County; Keith
                        Hodgson and Chris Riddle. (Chris is co-chair of CEWF and from the Kennisis Lake Association).</p>
                        <p>The recent (Spring, 2010) Newsletter “Where’s the Water”, prepared by the Coalition for Equitable Water Flow (CEWF)
                        (www.cewf.ca), discusses the impact on lake level management after the 2009-2010 dry winter. As of March 22 the only
                        dams spilling water will be Gull Lake, Moore, and Canning. All others will be in reservoir mode. The Gull River at
                        Minden is in dry bed condition. Rate of fill will depend on rains. CEWSF projects include discussions on the Water Budget. Individuals
                        can also find links to TSW water levels, which include Percy Lake as part of the Gull River watershed. As well you can

                        <p>On January 27, 2010 the Haliburton County Council met at the Minden County Building to hear the seven (7) applications
                        for the Grief land development project on Haliburton and Percy Lakes. Each application, three (3) "common elements
                        condominium roads" and four (4) "plans of subdivision", were summarized by the County Director of Planning. After
                        questions and discussion from the attendees, plus review of written requests, the applications were approved, pending
                        outstanding peer review and approval of various supporting reports. The reports include Site Evaluation (lake capacity,
                        terrain conditions, lake trout impact, natural heritage), Archaeological/Heritage Assessment, Nitrate Loading Impact
                        Assessment, Storm water Management Assessment and Site Development Plan. In addition to peer review requirements, the
                        development proposal was circulated to several agencies, i.e. Municipality of Dysart et al, Bell Canada, Ontario Hydro,
                        Canada Post, School Board, Emergency Services, etc.</p>
                        <p>During the fall of 2009 and this past winter, the road contractor has been active in clearing, roughing, trucking and
                        grading gravel for the common element condominium roads. Progress as of March 2010 includes final fill and rough
                        grading for the roads to access lots 1-15 beyond the Johnson Bay Road turn-a- round. In addition, the road is rough
                        cleared from the Percy Lake Road turn-a-round to within 250 meters of Haliburton Lake at the point where lot lines
                        start and portage easement to the lake.</p>
                        <p>For your reference, a proposed site map is available on the PLRA website (www.plra.net). Over the past 2 years PLRA
                        Directors have met with Wilson Consulting Inc., the developer's representative, on several occasions to discuss
                        requests and concerns. A couple of positives from the meetings are; the preservation of and dedicated portage trail
                        between Percy and Haliburton Lakes and the sand spit beach just beyond the narrows. These land tracts are designated as
                        Blocks 15, 16 & 17 that will be conveyed to Dysart et al and eventually managed by PLRA. Best estimate is that "For
                        Sale" signs may appear as early as late spring for the 15 east shore lots.</p>
                        <p>One question frequently asked concerns the large lots, ie: What's stopping someone from buying one of these large lots
                        and subdividing it into one or more small lots? The main issue is that it would be in violation of the Official Plan of
                        the County of Haliburton and the Municipality of Dysart et al. The OP specifically prevents an owner from subdividing
                        something currently designated as a "lot" without an amendment to the OP. The process is expensive and requires public
                        hearings, at which time current property owners would have an opportunity to present their objections. Even if one were
                        able to get an amendment to the OP, they would then face all the same difficulties that Wilson Consulting faced when
                        developing the Greif property. Paul Wilson was required to identify two potential septic fields and two potential building sites on each lot. Subdividing any of the lots would make meeting this
                        requirement difficult if not impossible.</p>

                        <p>Ken Loney made a presentation to Dysart Council on December 14th, 2009 in an effort to finally get closure on the issue
                        of waterfront storage sheds. All seven members of council went on record as supporting the allowance of sheds that meet
                        the stated criteria. There was some discussion about the problem of making exceptions just for properties on Percy
                        Lake.</p>
                        <p>Ken suggested to Council that, with such overwhelming support from Percy Lake property owners, it is likely that the
                        same support exists everywhere else in the township. Council seemed to agree and added the item to their review of the
                        appropriate section of the Official Plan that had just got underway.</p>
                        <p>We have since been in contact with Reeve Murray Fearrey who advised us that the review of the Official Plan went well
                        and the Township will be making an amendment that will allow waterfront storage sheds that meet the required criteria.

                        <p><span class="special">Did you know that...</span> the Lake Partner program will be starting up again this spring?</p>
                        <p>The goal of the Lake Partner Program is to better understand and protect the quality of our Ontario lakes by involving
                        volunteers in a water monitoring program.</p>
                        <p>Your Lake Steward will collect phosphorus samples and make monthly water clarity observations on Percy Lake. This
                        information will allow the early detection of changes in the nutrient status (too many nutrients are bad for our water)
                        and/or the water clarity of the lake due to the impactsof shoreline development, climate change and other stresses.</p>
                        <p>On Percy we will be collecting water samples from both parts of the lake to test for phosphorous concentration and water clarity during Spring, Summer, and Fall.</p>
                        <p>So if you should see your Lake Steward leaning precariously over the water in a canoe and pulling a long rope out of
                        the water with a bottle at the end, don’t think she’s lost her glasses or her mind, she’s just being a Lake Partner!</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">On another note...</span> I was walking along our beautiful Percy Lake shore the other day - admiring the views and listening to the newly returned birds, when
                        I was most startled to see a large trout languishing along the shore and calling out to me. I don’t know many trout
                        that speak or languish so I was most curious and went over to check this guy out.</p>
                        <p>Excuse me miss,” he called in his throaty trout voice, “I understand you are the Lake Steward around here.” “You are a
                        smart trout”, I replied. “And whatever can I do for you?” “My name is Tom and I have a little bit of advice from me and
                        my buddies who hang out near the bottom (of Percy Lake that is).’” So...</p>
                        <p>“Welcome back everyone to Percy! I know that all of you are anxious to get your property looking real spiffy, your
                        toilets flushing and your boats and ATVs all shiny and sparkly. Just remember that too many nutrients from fertilizers
                        and poorly maintained septic systems can create real problems for me and my fishy friends. We don’t get enough oxygen
                        and that makes it tough to breathe!</p>
                        <p>If you could...</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduce or eliminate fertilizer use</li>
                            <li>Pump out your septic system on a regular basis</li>
                            <li>Be careful with soaps – no bathing or other washing in the lake.</li>
                            <li>If you choose to wash cars, ATVs, people, boats, and your pet monkey and you are not draining into the septic system,
                            be sure to dispose of the rinse water at least 60 meters from the water’s edge.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Following these practices will help my fishy buddies and our food too!</p>

                    <p class="subheading">President's Message</p>
                    <p>As I started into preparing this newsletter,
                    it dawned on me how fast the past year has
                    flown by ! But what a great year it’s been!</p>
                    <p>The Association has completed a number of
                    good things ... the summer weather was
                    pretty good (unless you like sailing like I
                    do) ... the fall was lovely with all the
                    vibrant colours ... and although winter
                    started with a vengeance with several
                    monster snow falls, I’m guessing the total
                    came out pretty close to average.</p>
                    <p>I don’t imagine the snowmobilers were real
                    happy with the winter. We had a few
                    January rainstorms that really took their toll
                    on the trails and pretty much made the
                    lakes impassable.</p>

                    <p>But, it’s been a good spring.It was
                    fabulous for those of us who make maple
                    syrup. We got almost twice as much as any
                    other year so far.Most of the local
                    commercial producers had to stop
                    production prematurely on Easter weekend
                    because they either ran out of firewood or
                    jugs to pour syrup into!</p>
                    <p>The ice went off the lake four days earlier than last year and the black flies arrived right on time! Now hopefully,
                    Dragon Fly Day won’t be late! (Maybe you didn’t know that, around here, dragon flies hatch within a day or so of June
                    8th almost every year - and then proceed to chow down on those awful black flies).</p>
                    <p>And now another summer season is approaching. We’re all fortunate to be able to spend time in this paradise we know as Percy Lake, but let’s all help to preserve it. Stay safe and enjoy.</p>

                    <p class="bold">Why you should be a member of the PLRA</p>
                    <p>In the course of trying to convince various Percy Lake property owners to join the PLRA, the typical question we’re asked is “Why should I bother ?” . Well, there are two parts to the answer. First, when we appeared before Township Council regarding the waterfront storage shed issue, we were able to state that we represented 76% of the property owners. Council was impressed by the relatively high percentage of participation, but 100% would have been even more impressive. Second, most of the property owners around Percy Lake are seasonal residents but several members of the PLRA executive are permanent residents and have the time (and inclination) to attend weekday Council meetings to represent those who can’t be there for the meetings.</p>
                    <p>Come on folks - it’s only $20 per year for membership and the only way we’re going to be able to protect our little corner of paradise is by presenting a united front.</p>
                    <p class="bold">These are the issues with which we've been involved</p>
                    <p>Over the past year, the PLRA has been involved with a number of issues. We’ve represented the Percy Lake property owners at Township Council to reach a resolution on the waterfront storage shed issue. We’ve been working with Grief Brothers’ developer of the waterfront property to ensure continued access to the Gull River portage and the sand spit beach. We’ve represented the property owners at Township Council during the review of the Percy Lake Watershed Plan. We’ve worked with the Haliburton Lake Cottagers’ Association and the Fort Irwin Residents’ Association to convince Bell Aliant to bring high-speed Internet access to Percy Lake. And we’ve convinced Township Council that resurfacing of Haliburton Lake Road, Percy Lake Road and Johnson Bay Road cannot wait until after the waterfront development is complete.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Percy Lake Watershed Plan</p>
                    <p>Our lake plan has been accepted by Township Council and is sitting in a pile along with many others waiting for the Federation of Ontario Cottagers’ Associations (FOCA) to complete their report on how these lake plans should be handled at the municipal level. It is our understanding that the next stage is for the Township to submit the lake plans to the County for incorporation into the Official Plan of Haliburton County.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Waterfront Land Development</p>
                    <p>There have been a few developments over the winter.</p>
                    <p>Last fall, the developer (Paul Wilson) and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and the Ontario Ministry of the Environment conducted extensive water sampling tests on Percy Lake. They had several meetings to compare the results of their independent tests in order to resolve any differences so that the report that is included with the Plans for Subdivision is acceptable to all parties.</p>
                    <p>Earlier this month, there was a meeting at Township Council to discuss the development. The meeting primarily focused on the new roads that will be built. Council has directed the developer to include “common element condominium” roads in the Plan. As a result, owners of the new lots will share the costs of maintenance of the (estimated) 16 kilometres of new roads that are going in, and the Township will be able to avoid the costs of the staff and equipment that would be necessary to perform that maintenance.</p>
                    <p>At the same meeting, it was noted that the sand beach on the east shore of Haliburton Lake and the sand spit beach on the east side of Percy Lake will be deeded over to the Township. In turn, the Township will post the beaches appropriately (water access only, no motorized vehicles, no overnight camping, etc) and ask the lake associations to “monitor” them (ie: keep them clean and call the by-laws officer and/or the OPP regarding any infractions).</p>
                    <p>Paul Wilson advised Council that he expects to submit the Plans for Subdivision by the end of June 2009. It will probably take until next building season to get all the required approvals before they can start to service the first of the new lots.</p>
                    <p class="bold">High-Speed Internet</p>
                    <p>Good news! High-speed Internet is coming to Percy Lake</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the commendable efforts of Jack Russel, Dave Taylor, Jim Richert, and Gordon Cochrane (down on the north end of Haliburton Lake), Bell Aliant has been convinced to put high-speed Internet access into the north end of Haliburton Lake and Percy Lake. It was a lot of work, but these guys gathered together all those surveys we asked you for last year (even though it took a lot of chasing around) and used them to convince Bell Aliant that they had potential customers just waiting to sign up. Accordingly, Bell Aliant moved the project to the top of the priority list and committed to using the government assistance money to install the required equipment. Bell Aliant was quoted in the local Haliburton Echo as saying that necessary equipment would be installed in the late spring / early summer and the project should be finished by October 2009.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Annual General Meeting</p>
                    <p>The AGM will take place on Sunday July 5th, 2009 at 10:00 am at the FIRA Hall (5821 Haliburton Lake Rd). Murray Fearrey will be there ... so save all your hard questions for him!</p>
                    <p class="bold">PLRA Executive Meetings</p>
                    <p>The executive of the Percy Lake Ratepayers’ Association meets every long weekend from May to October for a couple of hours to monitor and organize the various activities in which we’re involved. We would like to extend an open invitation to any member-in-good-standing to attend a meeting, or if you have an issue you would like the executive to address, just contact one of the members of the executive for the time and location.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Fish Contest (16 years and under)</p>
                    <p>The PLRA fishing contest is open for the entire fishing season for lake trout and bass. Your entry may be reported to any Director of the association. If you prefer to catch and release, have a witness with you when you land that big one. The following rules apply:</p>

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Happy fishing!</p>
                    <p class="bold">Water Safety/Courtesy</p>
                    <p>It’s boating time again! Whether it be motorboats, canoes, sailboats, or personal water craft, we must practice some sensible, courteous boating. Let’s try to remember (and tell your visitors) to observe some safe, thoughtful practices while boating. For example:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Make sure that the person driving the craft is qualified according to the new regulations;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Keep boats well away from the shore, since it is unsafe for the swimmers;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Do not tow water skiers close or parallel to shore for the same reason;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Knowing that 84% of the property owners on the lake are <span class="bold">not</span> in favour of personal water craft, operators of PWC’s might be well-advised to spend most of their time out in the open and southern parts of the lake instead in the bays in front of somebody’s cottage.</p>
                        </li>

                    <p>Well, it's hard to believe that another has flown by.</p>
                    <p>Without a doubt, the most memorable part of the past winter was the amount of snow we got. I’ve only been coming to Haliburton since 1970, but this has got to be the most snow I’ve seen in that time - definitely the most we’ve seen since Wendy and I moved here in 2002. I can’t even imagine what it would have been like if we hadn’t had the three major rainstorms we had that melted most of the snow that was on the ground at the time. Doreen Douglas measures the snow at their place each time before they shovel and her records says that we had 17 feet, 2 ½ inches of snow this year !</p>

                    <p>It’s been a relatively active year too. Between the Percy Lake Watershed Plan and the meetings regarding the waterfront development project, there is no doubt that Dysart Council knows a lot more about Percy Lake than they used to. Percy Lake was also well represented at the public hearings before the Panel on the Future of the Trent-Severn Waterway.</p>
                    <p>Now, another summer season is approaching. I hope that you and your loved ones have the opportunity to enjoy our little piece of paradise here on Percy Lake just a few more days than you did last year. Stay safe and enjoy.</p>

                    <p>In the course of trying to convince various Percy Lake property owners to join the PLRA, the typical question we’re asked is “Why should I bother ?” . Well, there are two parts to the answer. First, when we appeared before Township Council regarding the waterfront storage shed issue, we were able to state that we represented 76% of the property owners. Council was impressed by the relatively high percentage of participation, but 100% would have been even more impressive. Second, most of the property owners around Percy Lake are seasonal residents but several members of the PLRA executive are permanent residents and have the time (and inclination) to attend weekday Council meetings to represent those who can’t be there for the meetings.</p>
                    <p>Come on folks - it’s only $20 per year for membership and the only way we’re going to be able to protect our little corner of paradise is by presenting a united front.</p>
                    <p class="bold">These are the issues with which we've been involved</p>
                    <p>Over the past year, the PLRA has been involved with a number of issues. We’re close to resolution on the waterfront storage shed issue. It is likely that the Township will allow storage sheds (that meet the agreed upon criteria) on the waterfront setback. The PLRA has been working with Grief Brothers’ project manager to protect certain areas of Percy Lake from the effects of the waterfront development that is coming. The PLRA has been working with Township Council to get the Percy Lake Watershed Plan accepted by Council and included in the Official Plan of Haliburton County. Last but not least, the PLRA has been working with representatives of the HLCA and Bell Canada trying to convince Bell that there is enough interest to warrant their capital investment to bring high-speed Internet to the north end of Haliburton Lake and Percy Lake.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Percy Lake Watershed Plan</p>
                    <p>We attended the Dysart Planning Committee meeting on January 7th, 2008 to do a bit of a presentation of our Watershed Plan. It went quite well. A few of the Councillors had actually read the document. There was quite a bit of discussion about the Waterfront Development project and the associated issues of roads, bridges, the portage, the sand spit beach, and the islands. We also discussed the "recommendation" regarding the sheds and Council was reminded that they had previously agreed to the terms. We received correspondence from Pat Martin (Municipal Planner) advising that our Plan has been "accepted" by Council and will be forwarded along to the County for incorporation into the Official Plan once FOCA releases their report on streamlining the process of including all these lake plans into the official plans.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Waterfront Land Development</p>
                    <p>The waterfront land development is progressing. We’ve met with Paul Wilson (Grief’s project manger) a couple of times this winter. While the formal submission of their Plan for Subdivision is still a ways off, the picture is becoming a little more clear.</p>
                    <p>Paul Wilson appeared before township council in February to get input from council regarding the 20 km road network that will be built for the development. Council’s position is that the roads should probably be owned and maintained by a “condominium corporation” which would be funded by the property owners on each segment of road. This would allow the township to put more funds into the improvement of the existing township road and bridges that will be affected by the land development.</p>
                    <p>Later in February, the PLRA and the HLCA met with Paul to discuss the latest version of the development map and the items on our collective wish lists. There are still 106 proposed lots (65 on Percy Lake and 41 on Haliburton Lake) but most of them are bigger because they go back to the new roads which have been moved back further from the waterfront. The lots average 6.5 acres and 610 feet of frontage. Paul Wilson has revamped the proposed lots around the Gull River portage and it’s likely that there is an 11 acre parcel along the north bank of the river that will be deeded over the township for public use. The sand beach issue might get resolved by the developer conveying those two blocks of land to the Municipality who would then ask the Associations to maintain and monitor them . The wetland in the southeast of Percy Lake might get conveyed to either the Municipality or Ducks Unlimited in order to get them designated as a "Provincially Significant Wetland". They are already zoned EP (environmentally protected) so a building permit can never be issued.</p>
                    <p>Paul Wilson's best guesstimate is that Plans for Subdivision will be submitted late in 2008. Approval of those plans and servicing of the new lots will take most of 2009, so the earliest the first (10 or so) lots will come up for sale would be 2010. The developer still hasn't decided which lots would go first - but logically the ones in the south end of Haliburton Lake would be the least expensive to develop.</p>
                    <p class="bold">High-Speed Internet</p>
                    <p>In recent months, Bell Canada announced that high-speed Internet will be offered to residents around the south end of Haliburton Lake. Bell offered the explanation that the offer was restricted, by the capabilities of the equipment, to residences that were within 5 kilometres of Internet equipment installation, which takes it up to about the area around the Haliburton Lake boat launch and the FIRA Hall. Since the announcement, we’ve been working with representatives of the HLCA and FIRA to try to convince Bell Canada that there is enough interest around the north end of Haliburton Lake and up on Percy Lake to justify the required capital investment in equipment to extend the offer. We encourage you to fill out and return the attached survey indicating your interest in signing up for Bell’s High-Speed Internet offering.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Annual General Meeting</p>
                    <p>The AGM will take place on Sunday June 29th, 2008 at 10:00 am at the FIRA Hall (5821 Haliburton Lake Rd). We are going to invite Murray Fearrey - Reeve of Dysart et al and Warden of Haliburton County, and Dan Kay - our local ward councillor.</p>
                    <p class="bold">PLRA Executive Meetings</p>
                    <p>The executive of the Percy Lake Ratepayers’ Association meets every long weekend from May to October for a couple of hours to monitor and organize the various activities in which we’re involved. We would like to extend an open invitation to any member-in-good-standing to attend a meeting, or if you have an issue you would like the executive to address, just contact one of the members of the executive for the time and location.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Fish Contest (16 years and under)</p>

                    <p class="bold">Water Safety/Courtesy</p>
                    <p>It’s boating time again! Whether it be motorboats, canoes, sailboats, or personal water craft, we must practice some sensible, courteous boating. Let’s try to remember (and tell your visitors) to observe some safe, thoughtful practices while boating. For example:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Make sure that the person driving the craft is qualified according to the new regulations;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Keep boats well away from the shore, since it is unsafe for the swimmers;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Do not tow water skiers close or parallel to shore for the same reason;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Knowing that 84% of the property owners on the lake are <span class="bold">not</span> in favour of personal water craft, operators of PWC’s might be well-advised to spend most of their time out in the open and southern parts of the lake instead in the bays in front of somebody’s cottage.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
