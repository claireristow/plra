            <h2>History of Percy Lake</h2>
            <div class="wrapper">
                <p>In the early 1800's, Percy Lake was one of many, many lakes in “Upper Canada” or “Canada West” that was
                    known as Pine
                    Lake.</p>
                <p>In 1859, the Crown Lands Department in Canada advertised a block of land for sale in the District of
                    Haliburton. The
                    purpose for the sale of the land was to promote rapid settlement of the newly created townships in the
                    District through
                    private enterprise. The townships included in the sale were Dysart, Dudley, Harcourt, Gilford, Harburn,
                    Bruton,
                    Havelock, Eyre, Clyde, and Langford.</p>
                <p>In 1861, the land was purchased by a group of English gentlemen, headed by the Honourable Mr. Justice T.C.
                    Haliburton,
                    and the Canada Land and Emigration Company Limited was formed under the laws of Great Britain in 1862.
                    Percy Lake, as
                    well as Kingscote Lake and Farquhar Lake, were named after principles in the company (reference: Early Days
                    in
                    Haliburton by H.R. Cummings). <a href="#" id="continueReading">Continue Reading...</a></p>
                <p class="firstHidden hidden">The purpose of the Canada Land and Emigration Company was to sell land to settlers, and in return, the
                    Company built
                    roads, conducted surveys, and built saw and grist mills. From 1863 to 1870, a large number of immigrants
                    came to settle
                    in the region. In 1869, Messrs. Boyd, Smith & Company, lumbermen from Port Hope, obtained the timber rights
                    on the
                    Company's lands in the townships of Dudley, Gilford, and Havelock. The lumber business caused an economic
                    boom in the
                    region. By 1871, the Company had sold 16,650 acres to settlers and a number of town lots to various
                    purchasers. In
                    1872, the Company built a road between the villages of Kenneway and Haliburton. Also, the Company
                    contributed greatly
                    to the cost of the connection of a telegraph line to Haliburton. In 1877, the Company contributed to the
                    construction
                    of the Victoria Railroad Company line from Kinmount to Haliburton with the hopes of increasing settlement
                    in the
                    Townships. This did not happen. By 1883, the Province of Ontario had begun to open up neighbouring
                    townships with
                    offers of free land grants. The Company was unable to cope with this competition. As a result, the Company
                    decided to
                    offer for sale its complete holdings and undertakings in Canada.</p>
                <p class="firstHidden hidden">The Canada Land and Emigration Company was purchased by W.H. Lockhart Gordon and James Irwin on April 11,
                    1883. It
                    should be noted that Mr. Irwin had previously been involved in lumbering in the area, beginning in 1877,
                    and had entered into partnership with Mr. Boyd, who was already involved in the timber industry at that
                    time. On April 10, 1889, Letters of Patent were issued by the Province of Ontario incorporating the new
                    Canadian Land and Immigration Company of Haliburton Limited.</p>
                <p class="firstHidden hidden">From 1890 to 1897 little activity took place. Sales of land and timber cutting rights had practically
                    ceased. In 1895,
                    Mr. Irwin declared bankruptcy and the bank (most likely the Canadian Bank of Commerce) took possession of
                    his rights
                    and interest in Haliburton, which included Irwin's shares in the new Company. During the 1920's the Company
                    sold the
                    entire township of Bruton to the Ontario Hydro-Electric Commission and proceeds from the sale allowed the
                    Company to
                    buy back from the bank the timber cutting rights previously licensed to Irwin.</p>
                <p class="firstHidden hidden">During the depression, lumbering activities ceased once again, but as more roads were constructed, the
                    region began to develop as a tourist and vacation area, and land sales began to increase. At the outbreak
                    of World War II, lumbering activities intensified, and carried on into the post-war years. By the end of
                    1946, all of the land originally purchased by the Company had been sold. The Canadian Land and Immigration
                    wound up its affairs, surrendered its charter, and ceased to exist.</p>

                <p class="firstHidden hidden">Four major logging companies, International Cooperage, Clayton Hodgson, Molyneaux Bryan and National Steel
                    Car owned the shoreline and back lots surrounding Percy Lake in the 1940's and 50's, prior to the time of
                    the development of the shoreline in the early 1970's. The Cooperage property encompassed the south end, and
                    Clayton Hodgson’s property went from Fosters around to and including the Douglas property on the north
                    shore. Along the way, Frank Price purchased the shoreline beyond Douglas’ east to the sand beach from
                    either National Steel car or Molyneaux Bryan. Most of the back lots are currently owned by Barjarows,
                    Delazzers and the Haliburton Forest (formerly owned by D. Bishop) and of course, Grief Brothers Inc.</p>
                <p class="firstHidden hidden">Clayton Hodgson built the logging road from Haliburton Lake to Percy Lake in the early 1950's. The road
                    routing was
                    basically the path of least resistance around large rock formations, beaver ponds and swamp land. Road
                    construction activity took about 3 years, as timber cutting controlled the rate of road development that
                    eventually terminated at Foster’s on the southwest side and Douglas’ on the north shore. It seems that Bert
                    Curry purchased the timber rights for a portion of the Cooperage property resulting in the need for logging
                    roads from Fort Irwin that led to the south end of Percy Lake and further to the southeast to Four Corners
                    Lake. Curry built camps and boat rentals at these lakes. Today, buildings from that era and land is leased
                    from Grief Brothers Inc. and maintained by active hunt camp organizations at both lakes.</p>
                <p class="firstHidden hidden">In 1954, Harold Douglas purchased lakeshore property from Clayton Hodgson that included a road/path right of
                    way along
                    the logging road from the original boat landing to his property. His cabin was built in 1964.</p>
                <p class="firstHidden hidden">The sale of the Hodgson shoreline property to Delbrook Ltd. in the early 1970's signaled the start of the
                    development on Percy Lake. Subdivision plans and surveys were approved by the Municipality and the first
                    lots (Boyd's, Dawysor's and a few others) were sold with only the original logging road as access. Cottage
                    construction was slow, as the road was not conducive to trucking in building materials. Materials for the
                    first cottages were trucked in in small loads, hand carried to the sites, or in some cases trucked from
                    Fort Irwin to the hunt camp and ferried to the shore of the building site. Improvement of the Percy Lake
                    road from Haliburton Lake to Foster's began around 1976 and was plagued by higher-than-estimated costs due
                    to revised routing because of land owner issues and a new boat access. As lot sales progressed, Johnson Bay
                    Road improvement began to open up the north shore for development around 1984. Several people who offered
                    recollections of Percy Lake development activities mentioned that Delbrook experienced financial
                    difficulties, possibly bankruptcy, and the lending institutions turned some of the properties over to
                    liquidators, such as Alness Properties, Charmath Investments, and Trillium Vacation Homes located in
                    Toronto.</p>
                <p class="firstHidden hidden">The Frank Price property development further to the east met some obstacles as Delbrook or their mortgage
                    holder(s) wanted some compensation for Johnson Bay road construction costs up to his property. Another
                    issue was that Douglas wasn't agreeable to the road to continuing through the middle of his property.
                    Somehow, the compensation for the first section of Johnson Bay road was resolved and the road construction
                    was continued to the north and east at Douglas Lane, after which Price started to sell the lots along the
                    north shore from Douglas Lane over to the sand beach area. <a href="#" id="collapse" class="hidden">Collapse.</a></p>
